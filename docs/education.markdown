- [2020-present] PhD Student, [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), Bern, Switzerland.
  > After finishing my master I knew I wanted to continue my studies. This PhD has been a great experience in which I can work on a specific problem looking for possible solutions. The guidance of my supervisors has been key. Being part of a lab is also a important aspect, because skills like team work and efficiency can be further developed. Visual Question Answering (VQA), which is the topic of my research, is definitely a fascinating subject in which the real ability of a machine learning model to reason is examined. {.texti}

- [2018-2020] Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Medical Imaging and Applications ([MAIA](https://maiamaster.udg.edu)), University of Burgundy, University of Casino and Meridional Lazio, University of Girona.
  > The MAIA program was without any doubt one of the best experiences of my life. From the beginning, a group of 22 students from all around the world studied together and moved together to a new country (France - Italy - Spain). The international component of the program allowed me to learn a lot about other cultures and languages. At the academic level the institutions offered the best education with great professors who pioneer in AI research applied to medicine. Important highlights of the master were the academic projects, the visits to hospitals and the visit to the Da Vinci Robot, which we were allowed to manipulate for some minutes. {.texti}

- [2011-2017] Electronic Engineering, [Universidad del Valle](https://www.univalle.edu.co), Cali, Colombia.
  > Since I was in school I knew I wanted to become an engineer. I spent a great amount of time in my childhood checking out what devices had in the inside, not always being able to put them back together. Studying electronic engineering in one of the best universities of my country allowed me to acquire skills in a broad range of fields like programming, machine learning, circuit design, telecommunications, etc. But definitely one of the best parts about my bachelor studies is the friends I made, with which I try to stay in touch.
