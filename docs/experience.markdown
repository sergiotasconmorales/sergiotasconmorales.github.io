- [2020] Internship, [Mediri GmbH](https://mediri.com/en/medical-imaging-translating-research-into-application/), Heidelberg, Germany.  
  > To fulfil the requirements of the MAIA program, I developed my master thesis titled "Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Using Longitudinal Normalization and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks" under the supervision of the managing director of Mediri, as well as two experienced developers. The master thesis focused on leveraging the time information in longitudinal multiple sclerosis (MS) studies to improve the segmentation of the lesions. This was accomplished by combining the well-known U-Net architecture with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This work received the award of best MAIA master thesis and was published as part of a workshop of the MICCAI conference.
  
- [2016] Internship, [Endress & Hauser](https://www.endress.com/en), Maulburg, Germany.  
  > During my time in Germany as part of the Young Engineers program of the DAAD, I had the chance of doing an internship for one semester. Under the supervision of two senior developers I worked on the improvement of software written in Matlab, as well as on the simulation of sensor electronic. Additional tasks included the analysis of models for linearization of pressure sensors and the evaluation of Python as a possible replacement for Matlab in the company. For this latter task, I prepared a workshop for the other members of the department. Participating in the team meetings allowed me to learn many things about team work, leadership and time management.
