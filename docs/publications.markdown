- Tascon-Morales S., Márquez-Neila P. and Sznitman R., "Consistency-preserving Visual Question Answering in Medical Imaging," (accepted to appear in the proceedings of [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/)) \| [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13296).
  > Visual Question Answering (VQA) models take an image and a natural-language question as input and infer the answer to the question. Recently, VQA systems in medical imaging have gained popularity thanks to potential advantages such as patient engagement and second opinions for clinicians. While most research efforts have been focused on improving architectures and overcoming data-related limitations, answer consistency has been overlooked even though it plays a critical role in establishing trustworthy models. In this work, we propose a novel loss function and corresponding training procedure that allows the inclusion of relations between questions into the training process. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, not only by improving model consistency, but also in terms of overall model accuracy.

## 2020

- Tascon-Morales S., Hoffman S., Treiber M., Mensing D., Oliver A., Günther M. and Gregori J., “Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Using Longitudinal Normalization and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks," Machine Learning in Clinical Neuroimaging (MLCN) workshop of the MICCAI Conference, 2020. \| [Link to Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66843-3_15) 
  > Multiple Sclerosis (MS) data is typically acquired in a longitudinal fashion, which means there are several time-points for a given patient. Very often this temporal information is disregarded. We propose a method to incorporate longitudinal i.e. temporal information into the automatic MS lesion segmentation process by using an architecture that combines the well-known U-Net with the LSTM networks. Using data from the ISBI 2015 challenge, we demonstrate that the combination of longitudinal normalization with the proposed architecture increases the performance and the inter-time-point stability of the lesion segmentation.
