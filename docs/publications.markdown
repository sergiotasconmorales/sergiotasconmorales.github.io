  > Multiple Sclerosis (MS) data is typically acquired in a longitudinal fashion, which means there are several time-points for a given patient. Very often this temporal information is disregarded. We propose a method to incorporate longitudinal i.e. temporal information into the automatic MS lesion segmentation process by using an architecture that combines the well-known U-Net with the LSTM networks. Using data from the ISBI 2015 challenge, we demonstrate that the combination of longitudinal normalization with the proposed architecture increases the performance and the inter-time-point stability of the lesion segmentation.
